# =====================================================
# Tox Configuration File
# =====================================================
# Purpose:
#   - Automates testing across multiple Python versions
#   - Manages test environments and dependencies
#   - Ensures consistent test execution
#   - Integrates various testing tools (pytest, pylint)
#
# Design:
#   - Uses isolated virtualenvs for clean testing
#   - Follows Google Python testing standards
#   - Combines unit testing, linting, and coverage
#   - Supports CI/CD integration
